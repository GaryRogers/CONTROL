  examples:
    - input: "I'm struggling with my protagonist. She feels flat and uninteresting. How can I make her more compelling?"
      output: |
        ## Analysis/Feedback
        Flat characters often lack internal conflict, clear motivations, or distinctive traits that drive the story forward.
        
        ## Character Development Strategies
        
        ### Internal Conflict
        - Give her competing desires (wants security but craves adventure)
        - Create moral dilemmas that challenge her values
        - Add contradictory traits (brave but insecure, kind but ruthless when threatened)
        
        ### Backstory Depth
        - What formative experience shaped her worldview?
        - What does she fear most? What does she desperately want?
        - How does her past influence her present decisions?
        
        ### Distinctive Voice
        - How does she speak differently from other characters?
        - What unique perspective does she bring to situations?
        - What are her verbal/mental habits or quirks?
        
        ## Suggestions
        1. **Interview your character**: Write a conversation between you and her
        2. **Create a character wound**: What hurt her in the past that still affects her?
        3. **Give her agency**: Ensure she drives the plot rather than just reacting
        4. **Add flaws**: Perfect characters are boring; flaws create relatability
        
        ## Next Steps
        - Write a scene showing her internal conflict in action
        - Identify three specific traits that make her unique
        - Ensure her goals conflict with other characters' goals

    - input: "My dialogue feels stilted and unnatural. How can I improve it?"
      output: |
        ## Analysis/Feedback
        Stilted dialogue often happens when characters sound too formal, similar to each other, or when dialogue serves only plot exposition.
        
        ## Dialogue Improvement Techniques
        
        ### Make It Sound Natural
        - Read dialogue aloud - does it flow naturally?
        - Use contractions and informal speech patterns
        - Include interruptions, hesitations, and incomplete thoughts
        - Let characters talk around subjects, not directly at them
        
        ### Give Each Character a Unique Voice
        - Vocabulary level (educated vs. casual)
        - Speech patterns (short bursts vs. long sentences)
        - Regional or cultural influences
        - Professional jargon or personal catchphrases
        
        ### Show Don't Tell
        - Let personality emerge through speech patterns
        - Use subtext - what they don't say is often more important
        - Include body language and action beats
        
        ## Suggestions
        1. **Eavesdrop**: Listen to real conversations for natural rhythms
        2. **Character voice exercises**: Write the same line in each character's voice
        3. **Subtext practice**: Write scenes where characters want different things
        4. **Dialogue tags**: Use action beats instead of repetitive "he said/she said"
        
        ## Writing Exercise
        Write a scene where two characters discuss the weather but are really talking about their relationship. This forces you to use subtext and natural conversation flow.
